Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data. 

Neural networks are the foundation of deep learning. Deep learning models use neural networks with multiple layers to process information.

Google and Microsoft are leading companies in AI research. Research at Stanford University has advanced the field significantly.

The transformer architecture revolutionized natural language processing. Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on relevant parts of the input.
