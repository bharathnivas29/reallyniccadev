  - 90-100% = Solid green dot (Very Confident)
  - 75-89% = Amber dot (Confident)
  - 60-74% = Orange dot (Uncertain)
  - Below 60% = Hidden by default
- Quick actions:
  - "✗" button to remove false positives
  - "+" button to add missed entities
  - Click entity to edit name/type
- Batch edit options: "Hide all entities of type X"

---

### **Feature 3: Advanced Deduplication** 🎯

**What Users Get:**  
Automatically merge duplicate entities so "AI", "A.I.", and "Artificial Intelligence" become ONE clean node.

**How It Works - 3-Tier Scoring:**

**Tier 1: Fuzzy String Matching (30% weight)**
- Catches typos: "Googel" → "Google"
- Catches variations: "Inc." → "Incorporated"
- Levenshtein distance algorithm
- Fast initial pass

**Tier 2: Semantic Similarity (30% weight)**
- Compares meaning via embeddings (384-dimensional vectors)
- Catches synonyms: "ML" ↔ "Machine Learning"
- Catches abbreviations: "AI" ↔ "Artificial Intelligence"
- Cosine similarity threshold: 0.85

**Tier 3: LLM Validation (40% weight)**
- Gemini API validates uncertain cases
- Checks context: "Is 'Bank' (financial) same as 'Bank' (river)?" → No
- Checks abbreviations: "Is 'WHO' the same as 'World Health Organization'?" → Yes
- Only called for medium-confidence cases (saves API costs)

**Merge Decision Logic:**
- **Total Confidence >90%:** Auto-merge, notify user
- **Total Confidence 70-90%:** Suggest merge, user confirms
- **Total Confidence <70%:** Keep separate

**Why It Matters:**
- Clean graphs without duplicate clutter
- "AI" (10 mentions) + "Artificial Intelligence" (15 mentions) = One node with 25 mentions
- Preserves aliases so users see all variations
- 85-90% deduplication accuracy (vs 60% for competitors)

**Competitive Edge:**
- InfraNodus: String-matching only (60% accuracy, misses synonyms)
- Neo4j: Requires manual MERGE queries (technical, error-prone)
- Obsidian: No deduplication (massive duplicates)
- Notion: No deduplication

**User Experience:**
- Deduplication log shows what was merged:
  - "Merged 'AI' ← 'A.I.', 'Artificial Intelligence'"
  - "Merged 'Google' ← 'Google Inc.', 'Google LLC'"
- Click any node → see aliases:
  - Main name: "Artificial Intelligence"
  - Also known as: "AI", "A.I."
- "Undo merge" button if user disagrees
- "Suggest more merges" button for power users
- Manual merge option: drag one entity onto another

---

### **Feature 4: Relationship Detection** 🔗

**What Users Get:**  
Automatically find meaningful connections between entities with confidence scoring.

**How It Works - Multi-Layer Detection:**

**Layer 1: Co-occurrence**
- Entities appear in same sentence → connected
- Frequency tracking: mentioned together 10× → strong connection
- Example: "AI and Machine Learning" appear together 15 times → thick edge

**Layer 2: Semantic Similarity**
- Embeddings are close → conceptually related
- Even if not mentioned together, show connection
- Example: "Neural Networks" and "Deep Learning" (semantically similar) → dashed edge

**Layer 3: LLM Classification (Feature 20 - Tier 1)**
- Gemini classifies relationship type based on context
- Extracts specific relationship from sentences
- Types: is_a, part_of, causes, uses, created_by, related_to
- Example: "Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning" → classified as "is_a"

**Relationship Strength:**
- Based on: frequency + semantic similarity + context
- **Thick solid line:** Strong connection (10+ co-occurrences)
- **Thin solid line:** Weak connection (1-5 co-occurrences)
- **Dashed line:** Semantic similarity only (not co-occurring)

**Confidence Filtering:**
- Only show high-confidence relationships (>70% by default)
- Reduces noise (no random connections from headers/footers)

**Why It Matters:**
- Shows HOW concepts connect, not just THAT they exist
- Reduces hairball graphs (only meaningful connections)
- Context-aware (distinguishes "Apple makes iPhones" from "Apple is a fruit")

**Competitive Edge:**
- Obsidian: Shows ALL links (extremely noisy)
- InfraNodus: Shows too many edges (hairball problem)
- Neo4j: Manual relationship creation
- Notion: No relationships at all

**User Experience:**
- Hover over edge → tooltip:
  - "Mentioned together 12 times in 4 documents"
  - Relationship type: "uses" or "is_a" or "related_to"
  - Confidence: 85%
- Click edge → shows example sentences:
  - "Google uses TensorFlow for machine learning."
  - "Neural networks are a core component of deep learning."
- Filter controls:
  - Slider: "Minimum mentions" (hide edges with <X mentions)
  - Checkbox: "Hide semantic-only edges"
  - Dropdown: "Show only relationship type X"
- Edge colors:
  - Blue: semantic similarity
  - Gray: co-occurrence
  - Purple: LLM-classified specific type
- Edge thickness animates on hover (pulsing effect)

### **Feature 10: LLM-Powered Extraction** 🤖
**(Moved from Tier 3 to Tier 1 - CRITICAL FOR ACCURACY)**

**What Users Get:**  
Deep, context-aware entity extraction using Gemini API for maximum accuracy (90%+).

**How It Works:**
- Gemini reads full text with context
- Understands domain-specific terms
- Extracts abstract concepts (not just named entities)
- Resolves ambiguity using context
- Provides confidence scores

**Examples of LLM Advantages:**

**1. Domain-Specific Terms**
- Medical text: Recognizes disease names, drug names, procedures
- Legal text: Recognizes case names, statutes, legal principles
- Technical text: Recognizes algorithms, frameworks, methodologies

**2. Abstract Concepts**
- "Innovation", "Democracy", "Justice", "Sustainability"
- These don't have proper noun patterns (spaCy misses them)

**3. Context-Aware Disambiguation**
- "Apple" → Company (if mentioned with "iPhone", "Tim Cook")
- "Apple" → Fruit (if mentioned with "nutrition", "orchard")
- "Bank" → Financial institution or River bank (context-dependent)

**4. Relationship Extraction**
- "X causes Y" → Extracts causal relationship

  - "Accurate mode found: 31 entities (8 more)"
- Progress indicator shows which method is running
- User can interrupt slow extraction
- Batch processing mode (process multiple docs overnight)

---

### **Feature 11: Custom Relationship Types** 🔗
**(Moved from Tier 3 to Tier 1 - CRITICAL FOR INTELLIGENCE)**

**What Users Get:**  
Instead of generic "related_to", see specific, meaningful relationship types classified by AI.

**Relationship Types:**

**1. Hierarchical (is_a)**
- Example: "Deep Learning is_a Machine Learning"
- Example: "Oak is_a Tree"
- Visual: Directed edge with arrow

**2. Compositional (part_of)**
- Example: "Neuron part_of Neural Network"
- Example: "CPU part_of Computer"
- Visual: Dotted edge with arrow

**3. Causal (causes)**
- Example: "Smoking causes Lung Cancer"
- Example: "Climate Change causes Sea Level Rise"
- Visual: Thick arrow with cause symbol

**4. Functional (uses)**
- Example: "Google uses TensorFlow"
- Example: "Researchers use Python"
- Visual: Dashed arrow

**5. Creation (created_by)**
- Example: "iPhone created_by Apple"
- Example: "Linux created_by Linus Torvalds"
- Visual: Dotted arrow with creation symbol

**6. Temporal (preceded_by)**
- Example: "World War II preceded_by World War I"
- Example: "Deep Learning preceded_by Neural Networks"
- Visual: Timeline arrow

**7. Generic (related_to)**
- Fallback when no specific type detected
- Visual: Simple line

**How It Works:**
- Gemini analyzes sentences where entities co-occur
- Prompt: "What is the relationship between Entity A and Entity B in this context: [sentence]"
- Returns: relationship type + confidence
- Multiple relationships possible (A uses B, B created_by C)

**Why It Matters:**
- Adds semantic richness to graph
- Enables queries like "Show me all causal relationships"
- Critical for research (understanding HOW concepts relate)
- Makes graph actually intelligent (not just visual)

**Competitive Edge:**
- InfraNodus: All edges are generic "related_to"
- Neo4j: Requires manual relationship typing
- Obsidian: All links are generic
- Notion: No relationships

**User Experience:**
- Edge labels show relationship type
- Color-coded by relationship category:
  - Blue: Hierarchical (is_a, part_of)
  - Red: Causal (causes)
  - Green: Functional (uses)
  - Purple: Creation (created_by)
  - Gray: Generic (related_to)
- Filter by relationship type:
  - "Show only causal relationships"
  - "Hide generic relationships"
- Hover shows full relationship description:
  - "Deep Learning is_a Machine Learning (95% confidence)"
  - Evidence: "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning..." [Source: Paper.pdf, p.5]
- Click edge → see all sentences supporting this relationship
- Manual override: right-click edge → "Change relationship type"
